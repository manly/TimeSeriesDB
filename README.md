Code dump repository of a project I never finished. It is functional, efficient and tested, but lacks the finishing touches to make this readily usable without having to write code.

The main reason for publishing this now is that I do not intend to finish this, but parts of the code are re-usable for other projects. The only reason this is here is so that I can point directly to a URL when referring to copied code.
